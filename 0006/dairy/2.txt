The picture shows a simple truth : If too many drops of water are put together ,they will become a sea. Many trees standing together form a forest and many people make up a society . It conveys a message to us : A whole is made up of many small parts that are closely related .Nothing or no one could exist alone .
The picture sets us thinking deeply : our society is made up of many people who have different personality and characters . If we want to create a harmonious society ,we must live in harmony with others . On the other hand , since everybody is related to others , we should be responsible for what we say and what we do so that we can develop a pleasant relationship with others , which makes it possible for us to enjoy life to the fullest .
