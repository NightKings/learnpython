What puzzles you is actually a puzzle for many parents in China . My idea is that it is quite right for you to do so .
Although high grades are an important factor in evaluating students and for their future university admission , development in wisdom emotion ,health and life attitude should never be ignored . There are many examples around us . Some all¡ªA students in school have turned out not to be as successful in society as they were expected. The reason is often that the pressure from their parents allows them almost no time for other activities . Furthermore , punishment is by no means a wise choice to help them grow up mentally and physically .
So I suggest that you take your friends¡¯ advice . More importantly, let her live like a lovely girl ; let her have more friends and social activities ; and let her make mistakes of her own as we teenagers often do .
